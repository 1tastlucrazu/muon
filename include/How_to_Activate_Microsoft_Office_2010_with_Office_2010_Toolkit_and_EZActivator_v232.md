## What is Office 2010 Toolkit and EZ-Activator v2.3.2?
 
Office 2010 Toolkit and EZ-Activator v2.3.2 is a multi-activator for all versions of Microsoft Office 2010. You can use it to activate one component of the MS Office, such as only Word or Excel, or the whole suite. It works with all versions of Office 2010, including Retail and Volume License (VL).
 
The tool was developed by CODYQX4 and Bosh, and it includes a set of tools for managing licenses and activation. You can also use it to reset the trial counter, add a working key, check your product key, view the status of activation, backup license, and remove/uninstall Office.
 
The tool uses two methods of activation: KMS and EZ-Activator. KMS stands for Key Management Service, which is a server-based technology that allows activation of multiple computers over a network.
